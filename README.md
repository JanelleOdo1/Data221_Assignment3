This repository contains my solutions for Assignment 3. Each question is implemented in a separate Python file as per the requirements.

DATA221-Assignment3-question1.py: A script that loads community crime data and calculates descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for violent crime rates.
DATA221-Assignment3-question2.py: A program that generates a histogram and a box plot to visualize the distribution and identify outliers in the crime dataset.
DATA221-Assignment3-question3.py: A script that prepares kidney disease data by handling missing values and splitting the dataset into 70% training and 30% testing sets using a fixed random state.
DATA221-Assignment3-question4.py: A program that trains a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier with k=5 and evaluates its performance using a confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
DATA221-Assignment3-question5.py: A script that tests multiple k values (1,3,5,7,9) to compare their accuracies and identifies the effect of k on model overfitting and underfitting.
